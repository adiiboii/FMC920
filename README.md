# Project Name
BWaY: A Mobile App for Tracking KSIT College Bus

## Purpose
This is a project under development as part of 6th and 7th semester project work under the Course Codes BCS685 and BCS786 of Bachelor of Engineering (CSE branch) of VTU at KSIT, Bangalore. 
This project is for ACADEMIC PURPOSE and not for any kind of revenue generation.
It contains source code, related documents, and other supporting materials.

## Description
- BWaY stands for "Bus Where are You?". This project aims to offer a solution by building a system for 'KSIT college bus tracking', connecting the GPS devices mounted on the KSIT college buses with the smart phones of the users (student/staff/parents etc.). 
- Through this mechanism the user will be able to track his bus in real-time.  
- The functionality of the envisaged system has also been extended to support emergency situations to track the bus. Thus, along with students, their parents or guardians, college staff and management, the user base includes the RTO Police, Fire Brigade and Healthcare emergency personnel also. 
- BWaY User Interface is being developed in Kotlin language on Android Studio, intended to work on Android based smart phones.
- For more insight into the project, please refer the following survey paper published.
